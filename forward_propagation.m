%%% forward_propagation
%
% A function that takes in a matrix of examples, as well as the weight matrices
% defined between the input layer and hidden layer, and between 
% the hidden layer and the output layer to compute the RAW predictions at 
% the output layer.  The output layer is not thresholded here, nor does any
% One-Vs-All action happen here.
%
% Inputs:
%  X - The input matrix of examples of size m x d0. m is the total number of
%  examples and d0 is the total number of neurons at the input layer without 
%  the bias unit, or the total number of features
%  W1 - The weight matrix defined between the input layer and hidden layer
%  of size (d0 + 1) x d1. d1 is the total number of neurons at the hidden layer
%  without the bias unit.
%  W2 - The weight matrix defined between the hidden layer and output layer
%  of size (d1 + 1) x d2.  d2 is the total number of neurons at the output
%  layer.
%
% Outputs:
%  Y - A m x d2 matrix that stores the raw predictions of the output layer.
%  Each row stores the raw outputs while each column represents one neuron from
%  the output layer.
function Y = forward_propagation(X, W1, W2)

    % Get the total number of examples
    m = size(X,1);
